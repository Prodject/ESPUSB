# ESPUSB
Wireless USB rubber ducky with real time interaction!
This sweet thing is only 1,2 * 1,3cm and fully covers in a USB port (stealthy).
Custom designed to be as simple as it can be and fulfill your malicious or trolling needs. ;)

Program your own startup code or simply pwn every nearby computer in real time over WiFi. This ESP8252 based HID keyboard/mouse creates a unique hotspot and simultaneously hosts a control panel to remote pwn PC's everywhere at any time.


Have fun!

EasyEDA project: https://easyeda.com/SinanAkkoyun/ESP8285 //don't mind the desc, idk how to change it xD
Code (will soon make my own code based on that): https://github.com/cnlohr/espusb/

//TODO:
/*
  Code is coming up when I tested the PCB IRL, so stay tuned!
  
  BIG shoutout to CNLohr, he is the greatest hacker/reverse engineer that I know from YouTube, he hardcoded the whole USB HID stack himself, the ESP does not natively support USB protocols!
