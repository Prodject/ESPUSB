# ESPUSB
<b>Wireless USB rubber ducky</b> with <b>real time interaction</b>!
This sweet thing is only <b>1,2 * 1,3cm</b> and fully <b>covers in a USB port</b> (stealthy).
Custom designed to be as simple as it can be and fulfill your malicious or trolling needs. ;)

Program your own <b>startup code</b> or simply <b>pwn</b> nearby computers on the fly in real time over <b>WiFi</b> (802.11). This ESP8252 based <b>HID keyboard/mouse</b> creates a unique hotspot and simultaneously hosts a control panel to remote pwn PC's everywhere at any time.

Have fun!

Code (will soon make my own code based on that): https://github.com/cnlohr/espusb/

//TODO:
/* Code is coming soon when I tested the PCB IRL, so stay tuned!
  
  BIG shoutout to CNLohr, he is the greatest hacker/reverse engineer that I know from YouTube, he hardcoded the whole USB HID stack himself, the ESP does not natively support USB protocols! */
